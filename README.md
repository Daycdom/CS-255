SNHU's CS-255 Course Projects
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was about designing a system for a business name DriverPass. This system was to cover a opening in the market for training new drivers via an web-based system that can be accessed and updated real-time. They had a pre-established business with 10 vehicles, and wanted to expand into the lack of online availability, where they can get up-to-date information about the DMV, students can take online tests, view their progress, schedule appointments, pay for different plans, and have an overview of everything they have done and need to do. This was similar for the instructors, who can view their schedules and specific student dashboards.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did the business requirements document the best. I feel as I covered most of the scope of the business within an relatively easy to understand, at least for a technical user, overview.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I believe the document that could use the most improvement would be the system design document, as some diagrams I couldn't fully cover everything I felt needed to be covered. It would in tern make my presentation better, resulting in a better representation of the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by taking as much information from the interview documents as I could in a literal sense, and transitioned them into basic useable requirements. I then expanded upon these basic requirements to include processes that would need to be included into the system to accomplish the goal of the user, including other processes that may not have been considered by the user due to a lack of technical knowledge. Considering the user's needs is the most important step in the design process of a system, as you are creating a system that the user would likely use every single day and the user will be interacting with that design every single day.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When approaching the designing phase of software, I try to get a basic understanding of the requirements, even if each step may be large. I then break down each step into smaller steps, then consider the requirements to complete each step. I try to break these steps down as far as possible without getting too detailed as when actually creating the product some minor details may need to change. Considering this, including a very rough pseudocode into the design phase may help on a personal level when designing to not miss any potential features that may be required on the back end.
